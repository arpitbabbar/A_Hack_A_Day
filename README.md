# EasyHealth 

A Health and Wellness app for keeping track of your existing appointments and scheduling new appointments with Doctors in your area.

## Inspiration
Many times we face this problem of not having appointment with our doctor when we need it the most. So, EasyHealth will let you schedule your appointment with doctors from your area via your mobile phone/internet.

## What it does
_EasyHealth_ makes possible for everyone to schedule their appointment with desired doctors from their area and also to keep track of their existing appointments. 

## How we built it
We've built this app using **MERN** stack. We've built all the frontend with **ReactJS** and have used Bootstrap for responsiveness. We've used **particlejs** for cool backgrounds and **NodeJS*** for all the backend part where we've developed our APIs (using **ExpressJS**) and managed our Database. We've used **MongoDB** as our database in _EasyHealth_ as it gives us flexibility to store our records as we wanted.

## Challenges we ran into
Being a backend developer, formating the frontend was our biggest challenge and I guess we did it well. Apart from it we faced some challenges in applying background using particlejs and while integrating APIs with frontend.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud that we're able to complete our project in stipulated time period and did great as a team. Apart from it we learned quite a few things that'll help us in future projects and did understand the hackathon structures as well :)

## What we learned
Mainly we learned about ReactJS and developing cool and responsive frontend using Bootstrap. We also learned about integrating APIs with our frontend and how to use Twilio APIs.

## What's next for EasyHealth
- Making some UI changes.
- Make it as flexible as we can and to scale it further.
- Building an app both for IOS/Android.
- Addind more features to it.
